          >Republicans start more firms than Democrats. Using a sample of 27
          million party-identified Americans between 1997 and 2017, we find that
          8% of Republicans and 5% of Democrats become entrepreneurs. This
          partisan entrepreneurship gap is time-varying: Republicans increase
          their relative entrepreneurship during Republican administrations and
          decrease it during Democratic administrations, amounting to a partisan
          reallocation of 340,000 new firms over our 21 year sample. We find
          sharp changes in partisan entrepreneurship around the elections of
          President Obama and President Trump, and the strongest effects among
          the most politically active partisans: those that donate and
          vote.</span

          >We examine social media attention and sentiment from three major
          platforms: Twitter, StockTwits, and Seeking Alpha. We find that
          attention is highly correlated across platforms, but sentiment is not:
          its first principal component explains little more variation than
          purely idiosyncratic sentiment. We attribute differences across
          platforms to differences in users (e.g., professionals vs. novices)
          and differences in platform design (e.g., character limits in posts).
          We also find that sentiment and attention are both positively related
          to retail trading imbalance, but contain different return-relevant
          information. Sentiment-induced retail trading imbalance predicts
          positive next-day returns, in contrast to attention-induced retail
          trading imbalance, which predicts strongly negative next-day returns.
          These results highlight the importance of distinguishing between
          social media sentiment and attention, and suggest caution when
          studying the social signal through the lens of a single platform.

          >We document political sentiment effects on inventors in the US.
          Democrat patenters are more likely to patent (relative to Republicans)
          after the election of Barack Obama but less likely to patent following
          the election of Donald Trump. These effects are 2-3 times as strong
          among active partisans (those that vote and donate), are present even
          within firms over time, and are detectable up to six years post
          election. We also find a large drop in patenting by immigrant
          inventors (relative to non-immigrants) following the election of
          Trump. Finally, we show partisan concentration by technology class and
          firm. For example, Republicans outnumber Democrats 3-to-1 in weapons
          patenting, but are outnumbered by Democrats 5-to-1 at Google.

          >Firms with only one bank relationship make up the majority of firms
          in many economies. This paper explores whether single-bank firms
          receive differential transmission of policy-driven lending during
          crises, in comparison to multi-bank firms. Using unique variation in
          the ECB’s Very Long-Term Refinancing Operations (VLTROs), which
          affected lending to firms discontinuously across credit ratings, but
          within banks, we find differential and attenuated transmission of
          VLTRO liquidity to single-bank firms. Bank lending standards appear
          lower for multi-bank firms, and total policy-driven lending to
          multi-bank firms grew by 50% more than lending to single-bank firms.

          >Government credit guarantees for bank loans direct vast volumes of
          credit and are the main policy tool used to improve firms' access to
          credit. This paper examines Chile’s credit guarantee scheme, which is
          similar to that of many OECD countries. Using a regression
          discontinuity design around the eligibility cutoff we find that
          guarantees more than double firms' borrowing without detectable
          increases in default rates. We also show that banks use guarantees to
          build new borrower relationships, an important and poorly understood
          process. The scheme also has an amplification effect: firms increase
          borrowing from other banks following a guarantee. Finally, we show
          that firms use the credit increase to significantly scale up their
          sales and employment. The fact that guarantees are not a common pool
          resource in this policy design is critical to understanding these
          results.

          >Changes in political leadership drive large changes in economic
          optimism. We exploit the surprise 2016 election of Trump to identify
          the effects of a shift in political power on one of the most
          consequential household decisions: whether to have a child.
          Republican-leaning counties experience a sharp and persistent increase
          in fertility relative to Democratic counties: a 0.7 to 1.4% increase
          in annual births, depending on the intensity of partisanship.
          Hispanics, a group targeted by Trump, see fertility fall relative to
          non-Hispanics, especially compared to rural or evangelical whites.
          Further, following Trump pre-election campaign visits, relative
          Hispanic fertility declines.

          >We find evidence of selective exposure to confirmatory information
          among 300,000 users on the investor social network StockTwits.
          Self-described bulls are 5 times more likely to follow a user with a
          bullish view of the same stock than self-described bears. This
          tendency is strong even among professional investors and is more
          pronounced on earnings announcement days. Placing oneself in an
          information “echo chamber” generates significant differences in the
          newsfeeds of bulls and bears: over a 50-day period, a bull will see 70
          more bullish messages and 15 fewer bearish messages than a bear over
          the same period. Selective exposure creates “information silos” in
          which the diversity of received signals is high across users’
          newsfeeds but is low within users’ newsfeeds. Finally, we show that
          this siloing of information is positively related to trading volume.

          >We use party-identifying language – like “Liberal Media” and “MAGA”–
          to identify Republican users on the investor social platform
          StockTwits. Using a difference-in-difference design, we find that the
          beliefs of partisan Republicans about equities remain relatively
          unfazed during the COVID-19 pandemic, while other users become
          considerably more pessimistic. In cross-sectional tests, we find
          Republicans become relatively more optimistic about stocks that
          suffered the most from COVID-19, but more pessimistic about Chinese
          stocks. Finally, stocks with the greatest partisan disagreement on
          StockTwits have significantly more trading in the broader market,
          explaining 28% of the increase in stock turnover during the pandemic.

          >Using a survey of 800 Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) in 22 emerging
          economies, we show that CEOs' management styles and philosophies vary
          with the ownership and governance structure of their firms. Founders
          and CEOs of firms with greater family involvement display a greater
          stakeholder focus and feel more accountable to employees and banks
          than to shareholders. They also have a more hierarchical management
          approach, and see their role as maintaining the status quo rather than
          bringing about change. In contrast, CEOs of non-family firms emphasize
          shareholder-value-maximization. Finally, firm-level variation in
          ownership is as important in explaining management philosophies as
          cross-country or industry-level differences.

          >In 2020, Chileans would head to the ballot box to decide their
          country’s future. Many international observers credited Chile’s
          decades of neoliberal governance with turning the country into Latin
          America’s “Tiger,” a prosperous, diversified economy on its way to
          becoming the continent’s first developed country. But in October of
          2019, a mass protest movement ground the country to a halt and shocked
          its political class, showing the world a different Chile—one defined
          by inequality, social distrust, and a young generation of political
          activists. As Chile prepared to vote in the fall of 2020 on whether to
          adopt a new constitution, could it sculpt a more equitable society
          while remaining “the exception” on a continent known for its political
          instability? Or would Chile’s prosperity go the same way as its
          neoliberal experiment?
