			We estimate that 3.1% of US voters, or 6.1 million individuals, were registered to vote in two states in 2020, opening up the possibility 
			for them to choose where to vote. Double registrants are concentrated in the wealthiest zipcodes and respond to both incentives and costs, 
			disproportionately choosing to vote in swing states (higher incentive) and states which automatically send out mail-in ballots (lower cost). 
			We call this behavior Cross-State Strategic Voting. While others have documented strategic incentives on who to vote for, this 
			paper is the first to consider strategic incentives on where to vote.

          > Many public policies – such as those on immigration, welfare, and policing – consistently
attract partisan political attention, often with a racial dimension. How a public
policy becomes politicized along racial lines is the focus of this paper. We develop a
framework in which political parties gain electoral advantage by framing policy in political
terms. This shows that an ex-ante group-neutral policy can generate political
polarization across different voter groups (e.g., by race), that polarization is larger for
cohorts learning about the policy at its onset, and that polarization persists over time.
We apply this framework to study the politicization of the Food Stamp program. Using
voter roll data for the entire U.S., we show empirically that the introduction of the
program increased political polarization across racial groups, that this racial polarization
was larger for voters that experienced the FS rollout at its onset, and that this
polarization persists today, about a half-century later. More specifically, we show that
individuals of voting age at the time of the program’s rollout (1961–1975) diverge along
racial lines in their likelihood of voting and registering as Republicans or Democrats,
with this divergence decreasing among younger cohorts. Our design ensures that these
findings are not driven by geographic or age-specific racial trends. We also explore contemporaneous
effects and additional contributing factors. First, we show that access to
the safety net also had short-run effects on voters’ beliefs and turnout, as well as on the
ideological composition of Congress. Second, we explore the interaction between Food
Stamps and contemporaneous events such as the Voting Rights Act and recessions.

          > Celebrities have long leveraged their influence to shape outcomes in politics, marketing, and now in cryptocurrency markets. As investors increasingly rely on social media for financial news and investment guidance, celebrities are playing a larger role in the landscape of financial advice. Using survey, market, and transaction-level data, we examine the persuasion rates of celebrity cryptocurrency endorsements on Twitter. Investors appear to treat these celebrity tweets as financial advice: controlling for crypto-related news, the probability of cryptocurrency investment by individuals on tweet days increases by 13.5%, with stronger effects among men, wealthier individuals, and older investors. We find that celebrities have relatively high persuasion rates and they impact equilibrium outcomes -- market trading volume in the targeted coin increases by 7% in the hour following the celebrity tweet. Finally, we show that a representative retail investor who trades following celebrity tweets makes negative returns after transaction costs.

          >Government credit guarantees for bank loans direct vast volumes of credit and are the main policy tool used to improve firms' access to credit. This paper examines Chile’s credit guarantee scheme, which is similar to that of many OECD countries. Using a regression discontinuity design around the eligibility cutoff we find that guarantees more than double firms' borrowing without detectable increases in default rates. We also show that banks use guarantees to build new borrower relationships, an important and poorly understood process. The scheme also has an amplification effect: firms increase borrowing from other banks following a guarantee. Finally, we show that firms use the credit increase to significantly scale up their sales and employment. The fact that guarantees are not a common pool resource in this policy design is critical to understanding these results.

          >We document political sentiment effects on U.S. inventors. Democratic inventors
		are more likely to patent (relative to Republicans) after the 2008 election of Obama
		but less likely after the 2016 election of Trump. These effects are at least twice as
		strong among politically active Democrats and are present even within firms and
		within firm × technology. We also show that partisans tend to cluster in technologies
		(e.g., Democrats in Biotechnology and Republicans in Weapons), so that sentiment
		effects aggregate up to more patents in the technologies dominated by the winning
		party.

          >Republicans start more firms than Democrats. In a sample of 40 million party-identified Americans between 2005 and 2017, we find that 5.5% of Republicans and 3.7% of Democrats become entrepreneurs. This partisan entrepreneurship gap is time-varying: Republicans increase their relative entrepreneurship during Republican administrations and decrease it during Democratic administrations, amounting to a partisan reallocation of 170,000 new firms over our 13-year sample. We find sharp changes in partisan entrepreneurship around the elections of President Obama and President Trump, and the strongest effects among the most politically active partisans: those that donate and vote.

          >We examine social media attention and sentiment from three major platforms: Twitter, StockTwits, and Seeking Alpha. We find that, even after controlling for firm disclosures and news, attention is highly correlated across platforms, but sentiment is not: its first principal component explains little more variation than purely idiosyncratic sentiment. Using market events, we attribute differences across platforms to differences in users (e.g., professionals versus novices) and differences in platform design (e.g., character limits in posts). We also find that sentiment and attention contain different return-relevant information. Sentiment predicts positive next-day returns, but attention predicts negative next-day returns. These results highlight the importance of considering both social media sentiment and attention, and of distinguishing between different investor social media platforms.

          >Firms with only one bank relationship make up the majority of firms in many economies. This paper explores whether policy-driven lending is differentially transmitted to single-bank firms in comparison with the multibank firms that are the focus of the literature. Using unique variation in the ECB’s very long-term refinancing operations (VLTROs), which affected lending to firms discontinuously across credit ratings but within banks, we find selective transmission of VLTRO liquidity to single-bank firms. Banks apply higher lending standards to single-bank firms, with banking relationships determining both new lending and lending maturity. By contrast, banks appear to transmit policy lending near-uniformly across multibank firms.

          >We find evidence of selective exposure to confirmatory information
          among 300,000 users on the investor social network StockTwits.
          Self-described bulls are 5 times more likely to follow a user with a
          bullish view of the same stock than self-described bears. This
          tendency is strong even among professional investors and is more
          pronounced on earnings announcement days. Placing oneself in an
          information “echo chamber” generates significant differences in the
          newsfeeds of bulls and bears: over a 50-day period, a bull will see 70
          more bullish messages and 15 fewer bearish messages than a bear over
          the same period. Selective exposure creates “information silos” in
          which the diversity of received signals is high across users’
          newsfeeds but is low within users’ newsfeeds. Finally, we show that
          this siloing of information is positively related to trading volume.

          >Changes in political leadership drive large changes in economic
          optimism. We exploit the surprise 2016 election of Trump to identify
          the effects of a shift in political power on one of the most
          consequential household decisions: whether to have a child.
          Republican-leaning counties experience a sharp and persistent increase
          in fertility relative to Democratic counties: a 0.7 to 1.4% increase
          in annual births, depending on the intensity of partisanship.
          Hispanics, a group targeted by Trump, see fertility fall relative to
          non-Hispanics, especially compared to rural or evangelical whites.
          Further, following Trump pre-election campaign visits, relative
          Hispanic fertility declines.

          to identify Republican users on the investor social platform

          beliefs of partisan Republicans about equities remain relatively
          unfazed during the COVID-19 pandemic, while other users become
          considerably more pessimistic. In cross-sectional tests, we find
          Republicans become relatively more optimistic about stocks that
          suffered the most from COVID-19, but more pessimistic about Chinese
          stocks. Finally, stocks with the greatest partisan disagreement on
          StockTwits have significantly more trading in the broader market,
          explaining 28% of the increase in stock turnover during the pandemic.

          >Using a survey of 800 Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) in 22 emerging
          economies, we show that CEOs' management styles and philosophies vary
          with the ownership and governance structure of their firms. Founders
          and CEOs of firms with greater family involvement display a greater
          stakeholder focus and feel more accountable to employees and banks
          than to shareholders. They also have a more hierarchical management
          approach, and see their role as maintaining the status quo rather than
          bringing about change. In contrast, CEOs of non-family firms emphasize
          shareholder-value-maximization. Finally, firm-level variation in
          ownership is as important in explaining management philosophies as
          cross-country or industry-level differences.

          >In 2020, Chileans would head to the ballot box to decide their
          country’s future. Many international observers credited Chile’s
          decades of neoliberal governance with turning the country into Latin
          America’s “Tiger,” a prosperous, diversified economy on its way to
          becoming the continent’s first developed country. But in October of
          2019, a mass protest movement ground the country to a halt and shocked
          its political class, showing the world a different Chile—one defined
          by inequality, social distrust, and a young generation of political
          activists. As Chile prepared to vote in the fall of 2020 on whether to
          adopt a new constitution, could it sculpt a more equitable society
          while remaining “the exception” on a continent known for its political
          instability? Or would Chile’s prosperity go the same way as its
          neoliberal experiment?
